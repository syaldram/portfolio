# Saad Yaldram's Portfolio

The goal of this project is to create a personal website that showcases my skills, experiences, and interests.  The site should be built entirely with HTML and CSS, JavaScript written by me.

## Deliverables

- HTML files for the structure of the website

- CSS files for the styling of the website

- Any assets (e.g. images) used in the website

- Javascript for animations and backend configurations

## Features

 - A hero section that provides a brief introduction to my background.

 - A resume page that lists my education, work experience, skills, and other relevant information.

 - A section that showcases any projects or work that I completed in the past.

 - An about me section that provides additional information about myself and interests.

 - A contact me section that includes information for users to get in touch with me.

## Backend
The web application is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The backend application diagram and infrastructure as code (IaC) can be found here in this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/syaldram/cloud-resume-challenge](https://github.com/syaldram/cloud-resume-challenge)

## CI/CD
The GitHub Actions enabled in this project creates a workflow that automatically builds and deploys the website whenever the code is pushed to repository.
